# Tests with evidence

The suite uses Effect v4 and `@effect/vitest`. Scenarios use `layer` and `it.effect`.
Effect owns the servers, HTTP clients, actors, browser contexts, concurrency,
raw evidence capture, and cleanup. The test runtime uses live clocks because it talks
to real processes. It does not import Executor implementations or construct partial
application servers.

Playwright is the browser driver, behind an injected Effect adapter. Its test runner
and fixture system are not used. React renders evidence only when requested.
Normal runs, including CI and failed runs, do not build the viewer, render videos,
or generate HTML reports.

## Run

```sh
bun install
bunx playwright install chromium webkit
bun run e2e:prepare
bun run e2e:self-host
```

`e2e:prepare` builds the dashboards, app framework, bundled Motel and shared
workerd runtime artifact. Run it again after changing these inputs. The server runs current TypeScript source. `bun run e2e:check` runs the
boundary check and TypeScript check; the root `check` includes it.

```sh
bun run e2e:local
E2E_ROWS=12 bun run e2e:self-host
bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'password login'
```

The default data-volume scenario remains 1,000 accounts with four concurrent
writers. Smaller runs use the same assertions. `--test-name` is a regular expression
matched against scenario titles, without the enclosing Vitest suite name.
Filtered cases are not counted as executed cases in the evidence view.

## Dependency injection

`support/platform.ts` supplies target configuration and native platform services.
`support/case.ts` composes the Layers used by Effect Vitest:

- `Target`: exact origin, runtime, data directory and private configuration.
- `SessionClients`: native Effect HTTP clients with independent cookie jars.
- `Actors`: fresh owner/admin/member sessions and an organization for each hosted case.
- `Api`: records each real request while preserving the test trace ID.
- `BrowserDriver`: scoped Playwright process, shared by a suite.
- `Browser`: isolated context per case, with an Effect `use` boundary for SDK calls.
- `Evidence`: named steps, screenshots, request timings and the final outcome.
- `Telemetry`: queries spans that actually reached Motel over HTTP.
- `McpOAuth`: public discovery, registration, PKCE, recorded browser consent, refresh and revocation.
- `McpClient`: scoped official MCP protocol clients with safe method/revision/trace evidence.
- `ClaudeClient`: real Claude Code in a Terminal Control PTY, with an injected model API.
- `RecordingFocus`: one clock and an ordered activity log for every recorded window.
- `Terminal`: scoped Terminal Control sessions; each `use` call selects that window in the recording.

Each test yields the services it needs. Native Vitest setup hooks start the isolated
server and provision the actors declared in the test plan. Provisioning belongs to
the setup deadline; scenario actions retain their full deadline. Scenarios that need
the default management app can declare `managementProfiles` with the required actor
roles. Setup waits for those committed profiles through public APIs. Scenarios that
exercise provisioning progress leave that prerequisite undeclared. Scenarios that need
another Testing SDK scenario declare `sdkScenarios`; setup creates each one in a
child scope the test may close. Native cleanup
hooks release those fixtures and close the server scope. `withCase` provides the per-case Layers;
`@effect/vitest` owns suite sharing and test interruption. The scenario deadline
is 60 seconds, with separate 60-second setup and cleanup deadlines and no retries.
`report/lifecycle/` records setup, scenario, cleanup and total elapsed times.
The report uses Vitest's final result so a cleanup failure cannot appear as a pass.
Effect scopes close browsers, save evidence,
and stop child processes. Owned server process groups get a 15-second graceful
shutdown window before Effect escalates to SIGKILL. `Effect.forEach` bounds concurrent writes and waits for
interrupted children. Transport failures are typed and do not expose credentials.

`e2e:prepare` builds `.local/test-runtime/host.json` once. Each isolated local or
self-host process reads that explicit artifact instead of rebuilding the same
trusted runtime. Rebuild with `e2e:prepare` after source changes; scenario data
and processes remain isolated. Product listeners use an OS-assigned port.

Local and self-host restart scenarios can advance persisted wall time while their
server is stopped through the authenticated runner control API. A runner-owned
preload, loaded by Node and Bun, sets wall time for source and installed CLI
processes. It is never packaged. The control API's `kill` ends the product process
group with SIGKILL, running none of its shutdown, to model a crash.
Sleep timers and duration measurements stay real. This tests
minute-based scheduling without adding a minute of sleep to each scenario.

Each case owns its fixtures. Self-host runs signup and invitations against a new
process and PGlite directory. Local uses its own process, database and pairing key.
Cloud shares one Worker and database while each case owns a random organization
and three synthetic identities. Managed Cloud serves the built site through that
Worker, including its static asset rewrites and server-resolved entry pages.
It does not start Vite's source development server. A runner-owned loopback process provisions Cloud
fixtures. It keeps database and signing credentials in memory. Neither those
credentials nor fixture endpoints are installed in the Worker.
The test plan declares `appOrigin: true` for scenarios that use private app URLs.
Deployed preparation verifies those HTTPS origins before the scenario deadline;
an origin that misses the infrastructure deadline produces a native setup failure
for its scenario. Beside organization provisioning, a dedicated organization
deploys one small app through `POST /apps/deploy` until the freshly deployed
compiler Worker builds it, within the same infrastructure deadline; otherwise
preparation fails with `CompilerNotReady`. An organization whose actors are not provisioned within their
60-second deadline does the same. Independent scenarios still run. The preparation
report retains each unavailable organization and its failure, the number of ready
origins, both phase timings, and each origin's probe count and last safe DNS, TLS,
or HTTP failure. All origin probes start together. Fallback
organization cleanup uses the worker bound and preserves release order within
each scenario, including when another organization's cleanup fails.

Files run in parallel with one worker per two CPUs by default, up to 16. Each worker
runs its own product server and browser. Use `--workers 1` through `--workers 32` to
set the bound. A file's cases retain their declared sequence.
Interactive recordings use one worker. Filters load only applicable files.
Each unattended test has a 60-second timeout, except the 1,000-account self-host
inventory case, which has 120 seconds. Cleanup hooks retain a separate
60-second timeout. Interactive inspection has no test timeout.
Within a scenario, use `Effect.all` or `Effect.forEach` with a concurrency bound
when operations are independent. Keep dependent actions ordered.

The self-host load case creates 1,000 accounts through four concurrent API
writers. The MCP catalog scale case deploys 29 apps with 7,000 tools and about
46 MB of input schemas, plus three MCP apps with profiles whose server never answers, and bounds
execute and search latency. CI gives both cases their own 16-vCPU Linux runner, one
after the other, in parallel with the functional suite. The PGlite workload depends on single-thread speed. Running both workloads on one machine can consume its CPU budget and
invalidate the load timing. The normal self-host command still includes every
applicable case. To reproduce the CI split, use separate machines:

```sh
bun run e2e:self-host --test-name '^(?!.*(?:Claude Code connects|concurrent owners and admins save every account|MCP execute over 7,000 tools))'
bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'concurrent owners and admins save every account'
bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'MCP execute over 7,000 tools'
```

## Shared SDK and interactive CLI

`e2e/sdk/index.ts` exports the same operations used by the runner and CLI.
`startEnvironment`, `startDeployment`, and `createScenario` require an Effect
scope. Closing that scope releases the owned resources, including after failure
or interruption. `runSuite` and `runDeployedSuite` own their complete run scopes.
`withHostedCase` composes actors inside the case's evidence and cleanup lifetime.
Tests that start signed out use `withCase`.

Start a foreground environment in one terminal. Keep it running while exploring:

```sh
bun run testing start --target self-host --handle .local/testing.json
```

Then use another terminal:

```sh
bun run testing create --handle .local/testing.json --label 'Account picker'
# Copy the returned id into SCENARIO_ID. It is an identifier, not a credential.
bun run testing seed --handle .local/testing.json --id "$SCENARIO_ID" --preset populated
bun run testing request --handle .local/testing.json --id "$SCENARIO_ID" --role member --path /api/viewer
bun run testing open --handle .local/testing.json --id "$SCENARIO_ID" --role owner
bun run testing list --handle .local/testing.json
bun run testing remove --handle .local/testing.json --id "$SCENARIO_ID"
bun run testing stop --handle .local/testing.json
```

The handle is a private file with a generated loopback capability. Do not commit
or share it. `stop` waits for cleanup. Ctrl-C also closes the environment scope.
An abrupt machine or process kill cannot run finalizers; temporary deployed
stages additionally have a lease for scheduled cleanup. Cleanup failures remain
failures and retain logs. Restarting an environment never adopts another run's
scenario identities.

Targets are `local`, `self-host`, `cloud` (managed local Worker), and `deployed`.
Local has no organizations, so it supports paired requests and browser use but
not organization populations. Deployed environments need the same explicit
credential launcher as `e2e:deployed`. The CLI stays alive to own their teardown.
`request` accepts `--method` and a JSON `--body`. All requests stay on the scenario's
product origin and use its own role session. `start --headless` keeps browser operations unattended. `open` owns an authenticated browser
and records screenshots, requests and video with the normal evidence adapter.

The `populated` recipe creates eight apps, 32 accounts, two groups, and 1,000
app records. `large` creates 24 apps, 200 accounts, and 10,000 records. Each recipe
owns a private GitHub emulator instance and real issued tokens. App queries make
authenticated HTTP calls to its private repository. Names and data are repeatable;
identities and emulator instances are unique. Override volumes with:

```sh
bun run testing seed --handle .local/testing.json --id "$SCENARIO_ID" \
  --shape '{"seed":7,"apps":3,"accounts":12,"records":500}'
```

Repeating the same successful recipe returns its receipt. A different recipe or
a failed seed requires a fresh scenario. Empty-state tests start empty. Other
tests can opt into realistic data through the same operation:

```ts
import { seedOrganization, populations } from "../sdk/index.ts";
// Inside withHostedCase, where Api and Actors are already provided:
const data = yield * seedOrganization(populations.populated);
// Use data.apps, data.accounts and data.groups in product API/UI assertions.
```

Turn an exploration into a committed test in `e2e/tests/` and register its title
and targets in `test-plan.ts`. Use the same SDK recipe and role API operations,
then add assertions for the behavior observed. `testing-sdk.spec.ts` proves
parallel populated organizations, equal resource names, real provider requests,
cross-organization denial and survival after another scenario fails.
`testing-cli.spec.ts` exercises the actual CLI through creation, role requests,
seeding, browser opening and complete teardown.

## Targets and shared behavior

The self-host release-image check runs against a prebuilt Docker image, outside
the source-server targets. It covers first-admin setup, an npm-dependent app,
encrypted account access, and retained login/app execution after replacing the
container with the same volume. It also compiles an authored frontend with
Tailwind and checks stored app data before and after replacement. It runs with explicit settings, local defaults,
and Railway's domain/port variables plus a root-owned volume. It also checks
non-root execution, generated key permissions, and refusal to replace missing keys.
The explicit-settings scenario also checks allowed internal imports, preserved Host
headers, and DNS rejection before any connection, including redirected imports.
It clones and pushes app source through the image's Git HTTP server, then checks
the committed files through the workspace API before and after replacement.

A separate case serves the image at a tailnet-style origin. It creates a Docker
network in `100.64.0.0/10`, gives the container a fixed address there and maps
`nexus.example.ts.net` to that address inside the container. `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
uses that name, and `EXECUTOR_APPS_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH` is unset. After
first-admin setup, an API key calls the built-in Executor app through `/mcp`. An
authored app then checks that it cannot fetch the container's private address.
The runner reaches the server through a port published on `127.0.0.1` in the
range 4431-4439. It sends each request with the tailnet `Host` header through
`node:http`, because Node's `fetch` replaces that header. This works with Docker
Desktop, OrbStack and Linux Docker. The case removes its container, network and
anonymous volume:

```sh
EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image-tag> EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_ARCH=arm64 \
EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_VERSION=<commit-sha> \
  bunx --no-install vitest run --config e2e/docker-release.config.ts
```

Use `amd64` when checking that image architecture. The scenario creates and
removes its own container and volume. It does not publish the image.
Build with `--build-arg EXECUTOR_BUILD_VERSION=<commit-sha>`. The image embeds this
identity in both dashboard assets and the server environment. The release check
requires the same version in a delivered server trace before and after restart.
To check an upgrade, pull the previous image and set
`EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_PREVIOUS_IMAGE=<previous-tag>`. The scenario creates data with
that image, replaces it with `EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_IMAGE`, and checks retained
login, encrypted credentials, app data, frontend availability and execution. It
reads the previous build version from the image and checks the new version after
replacement.

The same config runs `docker-oauth-renewal.spec.ts` against the image. It shares the
runner's network so the container reaches a loopback token endpoint that rotates
refresh tokens. A slow renewal holds its claim while other calls wait, a renewal
survives its caller disconnecting, and `docker kill` mid-renewal followed by an
immediate `docker start` recovers the grant within an execute deadline.

With no `E2E_CLOUD_URL`, the Cloud target starts the real Alchemy Worker and a
throwaway Postgres container on fresh ports. It provisions its external services
through emulators.dev and generates its own temporary database/auth values. It
starts with a sealed environment and an empty Alchemy profile directory. No
Cloudflare, PlanetScale, Google, GitHub, Context.dev, or 1Password credentials
are needed. Docker must be running; Bun, Playwright Chromium and ffmpeg are
normal tool prerequisites.

The disposable Postgres server allows 512 connections. The local Worker connects
directly, so concurrent requests and background jobs cannot share a pooler's
backend connections. PostgreSQL's default 100 slots can reject parallel
scenario startup. This capacity setting applies only to the managed test container.

Setting `E2E_CLOUD_URL` explicitly attaches to that server instead. A failed
attached target stays failed; it does not fall back to a local instance. The
report identifies the origin, managed/attached mode and local Worker runtime.
Attached role tests require the runner-owned `E2E_FIXTURES` loopback capability;
attached onboarding uses the stage's generated emulator fixture. Use `bun run e2e:deployed` to let the runner own deployment and teardown automatically.

`tests/hosted-shared.spec.ts` contains one Effect program with no target branches
in its assertions or UI steps: signed-out rejection, owner/admin/member permissions,
app deployment, account connection, tool discovery/invocation and both dashboard
views. A scoped finalizer deletes only its created app/account, including on failure.

The SDK isolation scenario also runs on the disposable Cloud stage. Deployed
runs use a scoped Axiom reader for delivered telemetry. This is correctness
coverage; it does not establish Cloud load capacity.

Neon stages connect to Neon's pooled endpoint and PlanetScale stages to their
branch's PgBouncer, both directly over verified TLS. Realistic concurrent CI coverage of that path is tracked in
[#508](https://github.com/UsefulSoftwareCo/executor-next/issues/508).

### MCP server scenarios

`tests/claude-mcp.spec.ts` drives the actual interactive Claude Code application.
It starts with an unauthenticated MCP URL, enters `/mcp`, selects Authenticate,
and follows the browser request opened by Claude. Self-host signs in through the
password form. Cloud uses an already signed-in synthetic browser session. Both
approve the organization, return to Claude's own loopback callback, verify its
successful connection, and invoke a tool in that same terminal session. A random
receipt absent from the prompt proves a real invocation.

The client's configured OS browser handler forwards its actual authorization URL
to the recorded browser. Claude performs discovery, client registration, PKCE,
the code exchange, and credential storage. The test never supplies an MCP token
or constructs the authorization request for this scenario.

`tests/mcp-server.spec.ts` separately checks the public OAuth/MCP protocol with
the official SDK client: anonymous rejection, browser consent, discovery, tool
execution, refresh and revocation. Both scenarios run unchanged on self-host and
Cloudflare, with target-specific browser sign-in supplied by an injected adapter.

Install Claude Code and configure its model API explicitly. We use VibeProxy's
Anthropic endpoint. The runner never falls back to a personal Claude OAuth login.
Supply `E2E_CLAUDE_BASE_URL` and `E2E_CLAUDE_API_KEY` through the environment or a
credential launcher; never put a real key in a command argument. Optional
`E2E_CLAUDE_COMMAND` defaults to `claude`; `E2E_CLAUDE_MODEL` defaults to
`claude-sonnet-4-6`. The interactive tool response has a 90-second wait limit.

```sh
# With model API variables supplied by your private launcher:
bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'Claude Code connects'
# Supply the Cloud environment attachment for both hosted targets:
bun run e2e:parity --test-name 'Claude Code connects'
```

Claude runs interactively with `--bare`, an explicit VibeProxy model API, no built-in
tools, and its own temporary configuration directory. First-run UI choices and
MCP authentication are driven through Terminal Control. Its private configuration
and cached credentials are removed on exit, and the test revokes its server grant.
One recording follows terminal → browser → terminal from the actual driver calls.
Original clips, the activity timeline and the edit plan remain in supporting
evidence. Recorded test and request durations do not change. OAuth cases discard Playwright's
network trace because it contains credentials; video, screenshots, sanitized
navigation, protocol metadata and request timings remain. Protocol revisions in
`mcp-*.json` describe the official SDK client. `claude-client.json` records the
actual CLI version, model, permission mode and model API.

`tests/local-claude-mcp.spec.ts` runs the same Claude Code journey against Local.
Local has no organization, so its consent adapter pairs the synthetic operator
through `/auth/pair` and `/auth/exchange`, approves the client on Local's
`/mcp/authorize` page and revokes the grant afterwards. CI excludes both Claude
scenarios because it holds no model API key:

```sh
bun run e2e:local --test-name 'Claude Code connects'
```

Executor's native tool-policy approval and browser tool approval remain separate
coverage. The SDK protocol scenario remains hosted-only.
App and grant cleanup uses public endpoints. Anonymous OAuth client registrations
remain on the dedicated stage because the product has no public deletion flow;
cleanup evidence calls this out. No active grants are deliberately retained.

## Evidence

The runner prints the saved run directory and an explicit render command. It keeps
raw case results, screenshots, browser/terminal captures, traces, Vitest JSON
results, and a combined `evidence.json` manifest. No rendering runs automatically,
even on failure. Test failures and empty filters still fail the test command.

When evidence needs review, render the retained run, then serve the report on
loopback. Rendering needs Playwright Chromium installed, plus ffmpeg and ffprobe
on PATH. The command builds the viewer assets. It does not start servers, deploy, provision
accounts, or need credentials. It can run after the test environment is destroyed.

```sh
bun run e2e:render --directory .local/e2e/<run>
bun run e2e:report --directory .local/e2e/<run>/report
```

For CI failures, download and extract the evidence artifact, then pass the
extracted run directory (the one containing `evidence.json` and target folders)
to `e2e:render`. Keep the target folders together. Rendering uses relative paths,
so it does not depend on the CI workspace path. Use the checkout at the run's
recorded commit. The SDK also exports `renderSuiteEvidence`; SDK callers must
build the viewer assets with `bun run e2e:viewer:build` first.

All assets and media use relative links. The React viewer
opens with a searchable results list, status/target filters and 50-row pages. Each
shared scenario appears once, with a separate result and duration for each target.
Selecting it leads with its recording or request evidence. Target controls switch
between that scenario's recordings without duplicating it in the sidebar. The target's exact URL remains
visible. Only the selected test loads media.
The viewer follows the system's light or dark theme, including native controls.
While dragging the seek bar, a thumbnail strip and timestamp appear above it.
Releasing the scrubber hides the strip. It overlays the footage so the scrubber
does not move. The exporter generates the eight-frame overview from the final
composed video, so it follows the same edit as playback. It loads only for the
selected test. Generation happens only during the explicit render command.
Existing reports without thumbnails retain the plain seek bar.

The player includes keyboard seeking,
five-second back/forward buttons, playback speed and fullscreen controls. Controls
stay below the footage. The report server supports byte-range requests for seeking
without downloading the entire recording first.

Local and CI runs use no artificial action or reading delays. Raw evidence is
still captured. For a deliberately slower recording, set `E2E_RECORDING_PACE_MS`
(0–3000). Playwright instruments individual actions, including multiple actions
inside one `Browser.use` call. The shared driver owns reading pauses; tests do
not add sleeps.

```sh
# Full-speed run with normal evidence capture
bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'Cloud onboarding'
# Deliberately slower recording for review
E2E_RECORDING_PACE_MS=500 bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'Cloud onboarding'
```

Reading pauses last twice the configured action delay. This only changes capture
drivers; API calls, server configuration and evidence encoding are never paced.
`recording-pacing.json` records the setting. Test durations include these deliberate
waits, so use unpaced runs for timing comparisons. Request and server span durations
still measure the actual requests. Cancellation interrupts pending reading pauses.

Recording focus is automatic in the driver adapters. Browser operations, checkpoints
and actor changes select the browser; opening or using a terminal selects that
terminal. Overlapping calls use the newest call's window. An older call completing
does not change focus, and saving artifacts during cleanup does not select a window.
The exporter follows `recording-timeline.json`, so a test can switch between windows
any number of times without phase markers. It trims idle tails and leading blank
terminal startup, holds short terminal results for reading, and retains the full
source captures. Terminal Control exports include startup so their time axes stay
aligned with the browser capture.

Tests save raw terminal captures and close their live sessions. Terminal video
encoding, browser address-bar rendering, and composition run only when requested
with `e2e:render`. The render command reports processing time separately. Each
recording has an `evidence-processing.json` attachment. Those times are excluded from the test duration; raw capture and normal cleanup still
belong to the test's resource scope. Export failures fail the render command and
retain the raw captures for diagnosis. They do not change the saved test result.

N/A means the test is explicitly irrelevant to that target, with the reason
available on hover. Not run means the test is relevant but has no result, or
requires infrastructure that was not available. For example, cloud scale stays
Not run until dedicated capacity exists. Recorded skipped results remain skipped.
Applicability comes from the scenario plan used by the runner and is saved in
each report; missing evidence alone never becomes N/A.

Each case saves steps, request status/timings, trace IDs, latency percentiles,
checkpoints, a Playwright trace and a video when it opens a page. Failed and
interrupted cases retain evidence. Native Vitest JSON results remain linked from
the report. A failing target makes the test command fail after saving raw results.

On explicit rendering, an Effect operation adds a 72px address bar with 28px text above
the recorded page. Query strings/fragments are omitted. Playwright renders the
bar images and scoped ffmpeg processes compose the MP4; the tested page is never
modified. Raw video and trace artifacts remain in the case directory.

The server log and complete Motel database remain under each target's run folder.
Saved trace samples are not a full trace archive. The telemetry test checks actual
server spans, status and the presence of SQL spans; client spans cannot satisfy it. While
running, `data/diagnostics/collector.json` identifies the collector query URL.

All runs use synthetic identities. Private run directories and session files are
ignored by Git. They can still contain session cookies and should not be published.

## State storyboard

Use `E2E_UI_OBSERVE=1 bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'Cloud onboarding'` to capture
loading and error states as direct screenshots. The viewer supports arrow-key
stepping, journey selection, previous-frame overlays, side-by-side comparison and
movement highlights. Browser layout-shift events after recent input are retained.

This opt-in managed Cloud capture pauses API requests and driver actions for
screenshots. Its durations include those holds; normal runs do not. Every observed
candidate is retained, with an explicit status if it changed before capture.
See [the storyboard guide](../notes/ui-state-exploration.md) for the protocol,
comparison rules and coverage limits.

## Pause, take over, resume

```sh
bun run e2e:inspect --test-name 'hosted roles'
```

The headed browser pauses at named checkpoints. Use that same browser normally,
then press Resume in Playwright Inspector. Server state, cookies, recording and
telemetry remain live. Failed interactive cases pause before teardown; cancellation
closes the owned scopes. Interactive cases are annotated as manual intervention and
do not count as unattended passes. Process-crash restoration is not implemented.

## Cloud actors

### Cloud onboarding with emulators.dev

Run the complete onboarding slice without environment files or account secrets:

```sh
bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'Cloud onboarding'
```

This is the existing E2E suite and evidence pipeline. The runner starts a real
local Cloud Worker plus Postgres and creates isolated Google, GitHub, Resend,
Context.dev and Autumn emulator instances. Company lookup has deterministic
matched and unmatched domains; the Google case verifies the actual suggested
company name before editing it. No real company-lookup key is used.

Each onboarding case begins signed out. Google and GitHub complete OAuth token
exchanges; email retrieves its actual delivered code from the mail emulator.
Passkeys use browser WebAuthn and real server registration/assertion endpoints
with a virtual authenticator. They do not exercise a native password-manager
sheet. Ordinary role fixtures use the runner-owned fixture process, which keeps
setup traffic out of the email sign-in rate limit.
Onboarding cases never use those prepared sessions.

The local test origin is `http://localhost:<port>`. Browsers treat localhost as
a secure context for WebAuthn, so the run needs no installed certificate or key.
No TLS verification is disabled. Real external services still use verified HTTPS.
The Worker is the real Cloud entry point; only external service configuration and
resource lifetimes vary. No alternate auth server is constructed.

The runner ignores inherited infrastructure credentials, sets `CI=true`, and
uses an empty per-run `ALCHEMY_HOME`. Alchemy beta.79's local Worker/R2/Hyperdrive
providers require the included patch to stop resolving cloud credentials for
local identities. Live providers and bindings explicitly marked remote retain
normal credential resolution. Generated test credentials are ephemeral, not
personal or production secrets. On completion the runner stops the Worker,
removes its Postgres container, removes the emulator credential file and resets
its external emulator instances. Recordings remain in the report.

These Cloud-only scenarios have explicit N/A reasons on self-host and Local.
Their recordings cover provider selection, company loading, edited team
confirmation/retry, passkey enrollment and returning sign-in after enrollment
or Not now. The loading-state case delays the original network request; it
neither replaces the response nor presents that delay as server latency.

For an independently deployed E2E stage, provision its external configuration:

```sh
node e2e/create-emulators.ts --origin https://e2e-your-stage.executor.engineering \
  --output /absolute/private/path/onboarding-emulators.json
```

The deployer supplies that file's `services` object as `EXECUTOR_EMULATORS` when
updating the dedicated stage. The mode is permitted only for loopback Cloud dev
or `test-e2e-*` stages; production origins reject it. It does not resolve real
social-provider, email, billing, company-lookup or OAuth proxy credentials.
Google signature, issuer, audience and nonce verification remain enabled.

```sh
E2E_CLOUD_URL=https://e2e-your-stage.executor.engineering \
E2E_EMULATORS=/absolute/private/path/onboarding-emulators.json \
  bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'Cloud onboarding'
```

That optional file contains generated emulator capabilities, not infrastructure
credentials. It is created with mode 0600 and never overwritten. Keep it private.
Provider emulation does not claim coverage of Google's/GitHub's live UI or native
Cloudflare mail delivery. The separate interactive Claude journey still takes
its model-endpoint configuration documented above; onboarding does not need it.

### Signed-in actors for other hosted tests

Use `bun run e2e:deployed --test-name 'Testing SDK|hosted roles' --workers 2`.
The runner deploys one dedicated `test-e2e-*` stage for the whole suite. After
migrations, a local Alchemy command transfers its database and signing settings
to the runner's authenticated fixture process. The setup validates the exact
stage origin, branch, database, and username. Every case then receives new
identities with one-hour sessions. Tests never receive infrastructure credentials.

Cloud cleanup restores cleanup authority for only its reserved synthetic
organization, calls the real product removal endpoint, waits for removal, then
deletes its synthetic users. This also handles partially failed provisioning and
membership changes. The enclosing deployment scope removes its stage even when
setup or tests fail. Existing stages are outside that scope.

For an anonymous check, `E2E_CLOUD_URL` alone is sufficient with
`--test-name 'cloud endpoint'`. Do not pass an old shared actor file to a suite.

### Workflow durability during a host deployment

The confirmed-write timeout scenario first commits a control mutation. Its
second mutation inserts and reads a row inside the transaction, then starts a
separate workflow as a durable observation before waiting beyond its timeout.
The scenario requires that observation and checks that the row remains absent
after the authored body would otherwise have returned.

The sleep scenario defaults to one second. On a dedicated deployed stage, set
`E2E_WORKFLOW_HOLD_MS=180000` to provide a three-minute host deployment window.
Interactive mode disables the normal 60-second test limit for this manual check:

```sh
# Supply the running environment attachment as described above.
E2E_INTERACTIVE=1 E2E_WORKFLOW_HOLD_MS=180000 bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'workflow sleep preserves'
```

Wait for `Workflow sleep window` and inspect the native Cloudflare instance to
confirm an unfinished sleep before deploying the same stage through Alchemy.
The case saves `sleeping-workflow.json` with the run ID. Capture the Worker
deployment and instance version before and after deployment, while the sleep
is still pending. After completion, `completed-workflow.json` identifies the
original run and a fresh run. Require a changed Worker deployment before the
sleep deadline, an unfinished sleep after that deployment, and successful
completion of both runs. The HTTP assertions require exactly one mutation
before and after each sleep. Record native workflow IDs separately: the
workflow `versionId` stayed unchanged across the verified Worker redeployment
and cannot be used as its Worker code version.

The ordinary attached suite does not redeploy its host during a scenario. A passing sleep scenario alone
does not prove a host deployment overlapped it; retain the provider timestamps
and version evidence with the report. The runner only forwards the bounded
hold duration, never deployment credentials, into the test process.

## Existing failure

The original 1,000-account run preserved every account and selection but lost later
server telemetry before it reached Motel. That delivery assertion remains enabled;
this runner migration does not relax its timeout or reduce the default data volume.

## Driver references

Anomaly's [Terminal Control](https://github.com/anomalyco/terminal-control), installed
as `@kitlangton/terminal-control`, supplies the Claude PTY and terminal recording.
Its bundled native binary exports MP4 through ffmpeg. [Browser Control](https://github.com/anomalyco/browser-control)
was reviewed for existing-profile browser adoption and human handoff; browser tests
currently use isolated Playwright contexts.

### OAuth URL policy regression

`bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'OAuth setup honors host URL policy'` exercises
the public hosted account routes. The managed self-host uses a named `.localhost`
callback with a static query parameter and one explicit HTTP origin exception.
The scenario checks HTTPS, the permitted HTTP origin and a denied different port.
It starts authorization with a synthetic manual client; it does not contact a live
provider. SDK protocol tests separately cover discovery, registration, code exchange,
refresh and callback parameter tampering through the production transport seam.

### Authored app observability

`app query traces connect browser, streamed host work, runtime and React commits`
uses a real app, checks two results while its stream is open, then closes it and
requires a complete parent graph. It checks linked source maps without embedded
source text and preserved drafts. Separate scenarios check warm query timing,
a failed subscription followed by a linked retry, and live access revocation.
Each scenario owns its app and organization. The retry scenario requires both
the failed attempt and its native link to reach the collector.

Self-host reads actual delivery through Motel. For a dedicated deployed Cloud
stage, bind `E2E_AXIOM_TOKEN` through the credential launcher and set
`E2E_AXIOM_DATASET=executor-next-test-traces` together with the normal attached
stage URL and private synthetic actor file. The query adapter reads only the
validated trace ID in the current run's time window. Personal Axiom tokens also
require `E2E_AXIOM_ORG_ID`; dataset-scoped API tokens do not. Partial or truncated
results fail; missing parents are never replaced by synthetic success records.

### Framework authoring and optimistic UI

`framework discovery deploys its checked example with optimistic updates and rollback`
reads the built-in app through MCP, checks native and imported tool output signatures,
follows a pinned skill topic, and deploys the example returned by `framework.describe`.
It holds the real write and reconciliation read at the browser boundary, checks the
optimistic row and draft, rejects a later write, then retries and reloads persisted data.
Run it with `bun run e2e:self-host --test-name 'framework discovery deploys'`.

`bun run e2e:local --test-name 'local MCP skills'` checks local framework queries
and topic routing alongside configured copies and pinned deployments. Package tests
cover queued writes, argument variants, read failures, unmounts and disposal.

`closing an app warns about queued optimistic deletes until writes settle`
holds writes and reconciliation reads while deleting three stored rows. It
checks the native close-tab warning for active and queued writes, dismissal,
failure cleanup, and safe closing after the last acknowledgement. Read-only
reconciliation must not retain the warning. The final API read verifies that
all three deletions persisted after the tab closed.

### Real Cloudflare environments

`bun run e2e:deployed` creates one disposable Neon-backed Cloudflare environment,
runs the ordinary Cloud scenarios, and destroys it even on failure. Supply the
staging credentials through the approved launcher. Use `--database planetscale`
for the release checks, or `--test-name '<scenario>'` for focused verification.
Alchemy disables Better Auth rate limits on automated `test-e2e-*` stages so
parallel scenarios do not share the runner IP's request allowance. Set
`TEST_STAGE_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=true` when deploying a stage for focused rate-limit
checks. Production and ordinary previews always retain rate limits. Local and
Cloud CI jobs use 16-vCPU runners. Self-host functional tests use a 12-vCPU Mac;
the 1,000-account test runs independently on a 6-vCPU Mac.
The same tests run on both providers. Add new Cloud scenarios normally in
`test-plan.ts`; no deployment fixture belongs in a scenario.

The deployed runner provisions the selected actor fixtures together before
starting Vitest. Each run gives each scenario a new 128-bit identity. The runner
then checks the actual HTTPS domains, including normal certificate verification.
Certificate issuance belongs to environment preparation, with a five-minute
limit, and is reported separately from test time. Per-scenario setup, assertions,
and cleanup retain their separate 60-second deadlines. The suite owns all
prepared organizations, including those whose tests never start after a failure.

Only scenarios declaring `runtime: "managed"` require the local Cloud target
(for example, local telemetry collectors). Their deployed report says N/A with
the reason. They remain in local CI. Claude Code's model-dependent scenario is
excluded by the deployed runner's default filter. A filter that executes no
scenarios is a failure. See [test stages](../notes/test-stages.md) for retained
previews, shared infrastructure, background pause/resume, and cleanup.

Scenarios declaring `runtime: "attached"` require a deployed Cloud target.
The compiler memory scenario uses large, pinned npm dependencies to exceed the
real compiler Worker's memory limit. It checks the typed error, the unchanged
active deployment, and a subsequent successful build. Local workerd does not
enforce that memory limit, so its report marks this scenario N/A.
Run it alone with `bun run e2e:deployed --test-name 'Cloud compiler memory failures' --workers 1`.
The default deployed filter excludes it because exhausting the shared compiler
can interrupt other scenarios' builds.

The private Executor auth scenario uses a disposable private Cloudflare stage.
Set `E2E_PRIVATE_CLOUD_URL` to its exact HTTPS origin and
`EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_E2E_PAIRING_KEY` to its manual pairing key, then run
`bun run e2e:cloud --test-name 'private owner pairing admits multiple verified passkeys'`.
The scenario adds passkeys and agent keys to that stage. Ordinary Cloud runs do
not select it.

The deployed job runs after the functional checks on `main`. PRs run the emulated Cloud target.
Main and manual deployed CI jobs share one non-cancelling concurrency group;
scenario workers remain parallel within each job. Agents can still run targeted
disposable deployments through this CLI. The job retains raw evidence and destroys its
own environment.

### Installed CLI artifact

To verify the installed CLI artifact through the same local scenarios, set
`EXECUTOR_E2E_LOCAL_ENTRY` to the absolute installed `bin.mjs` path and run
`bun run e2e:local`. The harness starts that entry from its isolated data directory,
with synthetic secrets. Pairing, dashboard loading and app deployment/call use
real HTTP requests against the installed package.

The first-launch key scenarios also run against an installed entry:

```sh
EXECUTOR_E2E_LOCAL_ENTRY=/path/to/node_modules/executor/bin.mjs \
  bunx vitest run --config e2e/local-bootstrap.config.ts
```

The OS credential scenario uses the real store and removes only its own entry.
The key file and denied-access scenarios never touch the real store. They start
the CLI with a stand-in keyring module that reproduces the package's errors: an
absent store, a cancelled or dismissed prompt, and a store that grants access.
Only an absent store may fall back to `keys.json`. The key storage scenario
covers `EXECUTOR_KEY_STORAGE`: `file` on a new or denied-pending directory,
no-ops on matching directories, refusals on mismatched ones, and invalid values. On Linux outside a D-Bus
session, set `EXECUTOR_E2E_CREDENTIAL_STORE=absent` to use the real missing
Secret Service for the key file scenario instead; release CI runs both.

The desktop artifact smoke uses the packaged executable, synthetic secrets and a
fresh profile/data directory. It deploys a dependency-using app, calls it, closes
the app, then calls the retained app after restart:

```sh
EXECUTOR_E2E_DESKTOP_EXECUTABLE='/path/to/Executor Preview.app/Contents/MacOS/Executor Preview' \
  bunx vitest run --config e2e/desktop-release.config.ts
```

Verify a locally built image without pushing it:

```sh
EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_IMAGE=executor-next-release:preview \
EXECUTOR_E2E_DOCKER_ARCH=arm64 \
  bunx vitest run --config e2e/docker-release.config.ts
```

Use `amd64` on an amd64 runner. The test checks the actual architecture, uses the
normal image command, and removes its own synthetic container and volume.

CI runs a separate cleanup step even after cancellation. It reads only the stages
created in that job, skips confirmed destruction, and retries incomplete teardown.
The registry lease remains the fallback if the entire runner is lost.
